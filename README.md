# GameServer
A Server in NodeJs that is capable of running multiple online multiplayer games

# Target
Target of this project is to support card games. Simple ones like Mau Mau or Uno should be possible, but also more complex ones (Like Phase 10 or event Magic)

A lower priority target is to support non-card-games as well.
